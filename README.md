# Full stack engineer exercice

**Goal:**

The goal of this exercise is to evaluate how well you can design a synchronization solution between a server and a client.

**Requirements:**

- Develop an endpoint `/user/:id` that get and edit the user profile (Name, Email, Avatar)
- We will need a frontend interface to display and edit the user profile
- On the frontend, we need to be able to display and edit the user profile offline.
- We need to be able to have the user profile synchronized between the frontend and the
  backend when we or online

**Technology:**

- Frontend: React based (React, Gatsby, Nextjs, React Native, etc.)
- Backend: NodeJs or Golang

Feel free to use the UI and design you want. Testing is not required but it is a plus.
We would like you to provide a git repository (Github) along with a short description of your application.
